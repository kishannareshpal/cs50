# My HarvardX CS50 courses projects

This repo holds all my submited projects and problem sets of these two courses (which are part of a Profissional Certificate):

-   **CS50 X – Introduction to Computer Science** (Ongoing)

-   **CS50 Web – Web Programming with Python and JavaScript** (Completed – Certified by [Harvard](https://certificates.cs50.io/c1e0137f-8c92-4f87-b278-0005a2f74af2.pdf?size=letter) • [edX](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/df8462b454f84c57bd00ab12a509c1d8))

## About

### CS50x – Introduction to Computer Science

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project (which I have pushed to this repo).

##### Weeks

-   :zero: [Week 0: Scratch](./x/week0/)
-   :one: [Week 1: C](./x/week1/)
-   :two: [Week 2: Arrays](./x/week2/)

### CS50w – Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This course dives into the design and implementation of web apps with Python (using frameworks like Flask and Django), JavaScript (ES6 with NodeJS and libraries such as ReactJS), Cascading-Style-Sheet (CSS or SASS using frameworks like Bootstrap) and SQL. Topics include database design, scalability, security and user experience. Through hands-on projects (which I have pushed to this repo), we write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku.
