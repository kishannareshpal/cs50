## HarvardX CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript Course Projects
My HarvardX Web Development course project source codes.

### Some background
This course dives into the design and implementation of web apps with Python (using frameworks like Flask and Django), JavaScript (ES6 with NodeJS and libraries such as ReactJS), Cascading-Style-Sheet (CSS or SASS using frameworks like Bootstrap) and SQL. Topics include database design, scalability, security and user experience. Through hands-on projects (which I have pushed to this repo), we write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku.
