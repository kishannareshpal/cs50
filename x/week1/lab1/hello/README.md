### Hello

A program which prompts the user for their name and then prints `hello, <name>`, where `<name>` is their actual name, by making use of the `get_string` method of the [CS50 Library for C](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/).

##### Usage

```bash
# Compile
$ make hello
# Execute
$ ./hello
```
