##### Requirements

:white_check_mark: Complete the `vote` function:

-   `vote` takes a single argument, a `string` called `name`, representing the name of the candidate who was voted for.
-   If `name` matches one of the names of the candidates in the election, then update that candidateâ€™s vote total to account for the new vote. The `vote` function in this case should return `true` to indicate a successful ballot.
-   If `name` does not match the name of any of the candidates in the election, no vote totals should change, and the `vote` function should return `false` to indicate an invalid ballot.
-   You may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.

:white_check_mark: Complete the `print_winner` function:

-   The function should print out the name of the candidate who received the most votes in the election, and then print a newline.
-   It is possible that the election could end in a tie if multiple candidates each have the maximum number of votes. In that case, you should output the names of each of the winning candidates, each on a separate line.

:white_check_mark: Must handle:

-   An election with any number of candidate (up to the `MAX` of `9`).
-   Voting for a candidate by name.
-   Invalid votes for candidates who are not on the ballot.
-   Printing the winner of the election if there is only one.
-   Printing the winner of the election if there are multiple winners.

:white_check_mark: Nothing else should be modified in `plurality.c` other than the implementations of the `vote` and `print_winner` functions (and the inclusion of additional header files, if youâ€™d like).
