##### Requirements

Complete the implementation of `runoff.c` in such a way that it simulates a runoff election. You should complete the implementations of the `vote`, `tabulate`, `print_winner`, `find_min`, `is_tie`, and `eliminate` functions, and you should not modify anything else in `runoff.c` (and the inclusion of additional header files, if youâ€™d like).\

:white_check_mark: Must handle:

-   An election with any number of candidate (up to the `MAX` of `9`)\
-   Voting for a candidate by name\
-   Invalid votes for candidates who are not on the ballot\
-   Printing the winner of the election if there is only one\
-   Not eliminating anyone in the case of a tie between all remaining candidates\

:white_check_mark: Complete the `vote` function.

-   The function takes arguments `voter`, `rank`, and `name`. If `name` is a match for the name of a valid candidate, then you should update the global preferences array to indicate that the voter `voter` has that candidate as their `rank` preference (where `0` is the first preference, `1` is the second preference, etc.).\
-   If the preference is successfully recorded, the function should return `true`; the function should return `false` otherwise (if, for instance, `name` is not the name of one of the candidates).\
-   You may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.\

:white_check_mark: Complete the `tabulate` function.

-   The function should update the number of `votes` each candidate has at this stage in the runoff.\
-   Recall that at each stage in the runoff, every voter effectively votes for their top-preferred candidate who has not already been eliminated.\

:white_check_mark: Complete the `print_winner` function.

-   If any candidate has more than half of the vote, their name should be printed to `stdout` and the function should return `true`.\
-   If nobody has won the election yet, the function should return `false`.\

:white_check_mark: Complete the `find_min` function.

-   The function should return the minimum vote total for any candidate who is still in the election.\

:white_check_mark: Complete the `is_tie` function.

-   The function takes an argument `min`, which will be the minimum number of votes that anyone in the election currently has.\
-   The function should return `true` if every candidate remaining in the election has the same number of votes, and should return `false` otherwise.\

:white_check_mark: Complete the eliminate function.

-   The function takes an argument `min`, which will be the minimum number of votes that anyone in the election currently has.\
-   The function should eliminate the candidate (or candidates) who have `min` number of votes.\
