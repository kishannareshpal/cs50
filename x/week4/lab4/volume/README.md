### Volume

A program which modifies the volume of an audio file in WAV format.

##### Example

```bash
# Double the volume by 2 of the input.wav audio file, and save it as output.wav file in the same directory
$ ./volume input.wav output.wav 2.0

# Lower the volume by half
$ ./volume input.wav output.wav 0.5
```

##### Background

[WAV files](https://docs.fileformat.com/audio/wav/) are a common file format for representing audio. WAV files store audio as a sequence of ‚Äúsamples‚Äù: numbers that represent the value of some audio signal at a particular point in time. WAV files begin with a 44-byte ‚Äúheader‚Äù that contains information about the file itself, including the size of the file, the number of samples per second, and the size of each sample. After the header, the WAV file contains a sequence of samples, each a single 2-byte (16-bit) integer representing the audio signal at a particular point in time.\

Scaling each sample value by a given factor has the effect of changing the volume of the audio. Multiplying each sample value by 2.0, for example, will have the effect of doubling the volume of the origin audio. Multiplying each sample by 0.5, meanwhile, will have the effect of cutting the volume in half.

###### Recall: **<u>Types</u>**

So far, we‚Äôve seen a number of different types in C, including `int`, `bool`, `char`, `double`, `float`, and `long`. Inside a header file called `stdint.h` are the declarations of a number of other types that allow us to very precisely define the size (in bits) and sign (signed or unsigned) of an integer. Two types in particular will be useful to us in this lab.

-   `uint8_t` is a type that stores an 8-bit unsigned (i.e., not negative) integer. We can treat each byte of a WAV file‚Äôs header as a `uint8_t` value.
-   `int16_t` is a type that stores a 16-bit signed (i.e., positive or negative) integer. We can treat each sample of audio in a WAV file as an `int16_t` value.

##### Requirements

Complete the implementation of `volume.c`, such that it changes the volume of a sound file by a given factor.

:white_check_mark: The program accepts three command-line arguments: `input` represents the name of the original audio file, `output` represents the name of the new audio file that should be generated, and `factor` is the amount by which the volume of the original audio file should be scaled.

-   For example, if `factor` is `2.0`, then your program should double the volume of the audio file in input and save the newly generated audio file in `output`.

:white_check_mark: The program should first read the header from the input file and write the header to the output file. Recall that this header is always exactly 44 bytes long.

-   Note that `volume.c` already defines a variable for you called `HEADER_SIZE`, equal to the number of bytes in the header.

:white_check_mark: The program should then read the rest of the data from the WAV file, one 16-bit (2-byte) sample at a time. Your program should multiply each sample by the `factor` and write the new sample to the output file.\

-   You may assume that the WAV file will use 16-bit signed values as samples. In practice, WAV files can have varying numbers of bits per sample, but we‚Äôll assume 16-bit samples for this lab.\

:white_check_mark: Your program, if it uses `malloc`, must not leak any memory.

##### Usage

```bash
# Compile
$ make volume
# Execute
$ ./volume input output factor
```
